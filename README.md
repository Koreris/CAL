# Emergency Call Center

### Description

This project is a simulation of an emergency center. 
The goal is to allocate the resources (ambulances, motorcycles, helicopters) needed for each call as efficiently as possible. 
We have used Dijkstra's algorithm.

For the second part of the work we used Full-Text-Seach Techniques as also Pattern matching and String matching.
